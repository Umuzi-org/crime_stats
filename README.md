Crime Stats 

The aim of the Crime Stats project is to assess:
•	The most frequently occurring crimes int he Gauteng region
•	When and where the five most frequently occurring crimes happen
•	Whether fear of crime is preventing people from moving around freely and participating in the community
•	What services people currently use when having experienced a crime

Analysis
1.	Unzip the two files. Household contains information about perceptions of crime. Section 21-28 contains information about crimes experienced. We will use both.
2.	Import the data to python with pandas.read_csv()
3.	Extract the data for Gauteng only (Code: 7 = Gauteng). Check that the metro codes are correct (should now only include Gauteng metros).
4.	Create graphs to visualise the crime statistics

See the Report instructions for more information on the project.
